my problem

solution #2
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65398315/countdown-server-side-best-practices
-start the game, clicked or triggered in client
-then, set interval in server with roomID
-everytime, the user wants to reconnect, just get the current countdown in server
-then display the time in client side
-you can do this after joining the room.
problem #1
-emit game end
-add function in the object or manual function but pano ka magpapasa ng data?
